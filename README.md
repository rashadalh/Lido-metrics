# Lido-metrics

This repo contains work I did for a potential client on measuring growth trends in wstETH trading. This analysis makes use of both on and off chain sources making use of infura, the official lido smart contract,
the graph protocol, and some CEX data via Bybit. "lidoKPIs_OnChain.ipynb" shows the onchain analytics, and "lidoKPIs_CEX.ipynb" shows the off-chain analysis. Both notebooks contain my thoughts and comments to the
questions asked.
